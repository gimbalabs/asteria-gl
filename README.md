# Asteria-GL (Asteria Gimbalabs)
Asteria front-end project Spring 2025

## Introduction
This is the Asteria-GL project. This is a three month long learning project conducted by four Gimbalabs contributors in order to learn the T3 tech stack and Mesh and collaboration in Web3 development.The real world project is the Astoria game by TX pipe, which is a project catalyst funded eUTXO learning game.

Our guiding question is:How can we refactor and build a frontend for the game using Mesh instead of Lucid.

This learning project has three phases.
- Phase one is research. 
- Phase two is "build it for ourselves". 
- Third phase is "create a project for others to build". 

This project is funded by Gimbalabs and was consented to during the open spaces on Thursdays.  The proposal for this is on our Notion.
